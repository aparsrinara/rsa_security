1. As told in lecture m must be less than n, becuase m mod n will equal 
   m. The message will be altered so the encryption will not work out 
   properly anymore, if m is greater than n, since m mod n will no longer be m. Cryptosystems in general will break down the message
   into packets to make sure that each part is less than n. 


2. If you encrypt the same message twice it will return the same value
   each time. This allows a chosen plaintext attack. If you send 0s and 1s
   you know what a 0 or a 1 encodes to. Thus if you are watching over a message
   passing sequence, you can find out what certain phrases or words encode to
   so when you see those words appear in the passing of messages between Alice
   and Bob, you'll know what words mapped to what specific encrypted values.
